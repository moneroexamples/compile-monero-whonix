And this, might be not\r\nideal situation for some.\r\n\r\nOne way to overcome this problem is to run the node through Tor. And this can be done having the Monero node running inside the Whonix Workstation.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, one can use Tor through `torsocks` as explained [here](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero#using-tor).\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\n Assuming that you have Whonix setup into your VirtualBox, the first thing that\r\n should be done is to increase Whonix-Workstation's ram. The default size\r\n is 768 MB, and this is not enough for compilation. I usually set it up to 2 GB, but I think 1GB should also be good.\r\n\r\n ```bash\r\n VBoxManage modifyvm Whonix-Workstation --memory 2048\r\n ```\r\n\r\n## Compilation\r\nStart your Whonix-Workstation and do the following in the workstation.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# install dependencies\r\nsudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost1.55-all-dev miniupnpc  libunbound-dev graphviz doxygen liblmdb-dev libssl-dev pkg-config\r\n\r\n# download the latest bitmonero source code from github\r\ngit clone https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero.git\r\n\r\n# go into bitmonero folder\r\ncd bitmonero/\r\n\r\n# compile\r\nmake release-static-32\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter successful compilation, the Monero binaries should be located in `./build/release/bin/`\r\n\r\nI usually move the binaries into `/opt/bitmonero/` folder, so this can be done\r\nas follows:\r\n```\r\nsudo mkdir /opt/bitmonero\r\nsudo mv -v ./build/release/bin/* /opt/bitmonero/\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo start now the only think left is to start the Monero daemon and let it\r\ndownload the blockchain and synchronize with the Monero network. After that,\r\nyou can run your the `simplewallet`.\r\n\r\nPlease note that downloading the full blockchain will probably be slow. So it would be better to download it independently\r\nand then copy to the default Monero folder, i.e., `~/.bitmonero/lmdb/`\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# launch the Monero node daemon and let it synchronize with the Monero network\r\n/opt/bitmonero/bitmonerod\r\n\r\n# launch the Monero wallet\r\n#/opt/bitmonero/simplewallet\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example screenshot\r\n`bitmonerod` daemon and `simplewallet` in Whonix Workstation:\r\n![Before](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-whonix/master/img/whonix_monero.jpg)\r\n\r\n## How can you help?\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, code and website edits are always good. They can be made through github.\r\n\r\nSome Monero are also welcome:\r\n```\r\n48daf1rG3hE1Txapcsxh6WXNe9MLNKtu7W7tKTivtSoVLHErYzvdcpea2nSTgGkz66RFP4GKVAsTV14v6G3oddBTHfxP6tU\r\n```    \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
